<h3>Description</h3>
This is a delicious, fast and healthy meal!
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li></li>
    <li>4 T soy sauce</li>
    <li>2 t dark sesame oil</li>
    <li>1 t sugar</li>
    <li>1 t mirin</li>
    <li>2 t red wine vinegar</li>
    <li>8 ounces tofu</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
<li>Place a large pot of water on to boil. In a large bowl, mix together 2 tbsp. soy sauce and 1 tsp. sesame oil. Add the tofu and marinate as you heat a non-stick skillet lightly coated with oil or pan spray.</li>
<li>Trim and chop the asparagus. When the skillet is hot, lift the tofu out of the marinade with a slotted spoon and put it in the skillet. Cook, turning, until brown on all sides.</li>
<li>While the tofu is cooking, add 1 tbsp. soy sauce plus the sugar, mirin, red wine vinegar, and minced garlic to the marinade. When the tofu is done, add it to the marinade in the bowl, stir it, and set it aside.</li>
<li>By now the water should be boiling. Add the asparagus and cover. Cook for 2 minutes. Remove asparagus with a slotted spoon and toss it together with the tofu and marinade.</li>
<li>Return the water to a boil, add salt (optional), and add the somen. Cook until pasta is tender, about 4 minutes. Drain it, return it to the pan, and toss it with 1 tablespoon of soy sauce and 1 tsp. of sesame oil. Serve immediately with asparagus and tofu mixture on top.</li>
